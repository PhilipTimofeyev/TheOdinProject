Substring:


Inputs: a string, an array of strings
Output: Hash of substrings as key and how many times substring is found as integer.

Implicit requirements:
Each substring in hash is case insensitive
Method must handle multiple words in first argument
If part of the word from the dictionary is in a word in the first argument, it counts. ie. "how" >> "how's"

Algorithm:

Split the words in the first argument
Iterate over the dictionary array, checking if a word is in the first argument words.
If a word exists, add the word to a hash and raise count by one.
Return hash.
