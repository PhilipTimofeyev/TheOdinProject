Algorithm:

1. Open dictionary and select a word between 5-12 characters long.
2. Create an array where guesses go.
3. Retrieve input from person on letter that is validated
4. Place letter into guess array.
5. On each turn, iterate over dictionary word and if the letter exists in the guess array, then display it, if not, then display "_"
6. Each incorrect guess, lower the guesses count by 1.
7. When guesses hit 0, player loses. If all letters of the guess array exist in dictionary array before count runs out, then player wins.
