Stockpicker:


Inputs: an array of integers
Output: an array of two integers representing indexes 

Implicit requirements:
Return a pair of days representing best day to buy and best day to sell
Day to buy is first index, day to sell is second
Days start at 0
Need to buy before sell. So cannot buy on 5th day and sell on 3rd day.

Algorithm:

Do an iteration on top of an iteration by iterating the first element, then subtracting every element after the first while recording both indexes.

Add these values to an array with three elements: index of first day, index of second day, and value of the difference.

Find the max difference value of the array and return the first and second index.

If there is more than one buy/sell pair that give the same difference, include in the result.

Raise error if only one day of stocks.
